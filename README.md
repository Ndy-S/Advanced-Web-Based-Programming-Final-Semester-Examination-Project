# Graduation Prediction CRUD
This project is a university assignment that implements basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python Flask for the backend. It also features a graduation outcome prediction system utilizing the Support Vector Machines (SVM) machine learning algorithm.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Implements a backend server using Python Flask that supports CRUD operations.
- **Database Interaction**: Connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve data for various entities.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Includes a simple graduation prediction feature using the SVM algorithm.

## Usage
1. Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the Flask application.
2. Run the Flask server: `python app.py`.
3. Access the CRUD endpoints via HTTP requests to perform operations on the data.
4. For graduation prediction, ensure the necessary data is available and accessible to the SVM model.
