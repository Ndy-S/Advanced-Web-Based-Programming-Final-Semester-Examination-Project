# CRUD Project with Python Flask and Graduation Prediction
This project serves as a university assignment implementation, focusing on basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python Flask for the backend. Additionally, it includes a feature for predicting graduation outcomes using Support Vector Machines (SVM) machine learning algorithm.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Utilizes Python Flask to create a backend server supporting CRUD operations.
- **Database Interaction**: Interacts with a MySQL database to store and retrieve data for various entities.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implements a simple graduation prediction feature using SVM.

## Usage
1. Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the Flask application.
2. Run the Flask server: `python app.py`
3. Access the CRUD endpoints via HTTP requests to perform operations on the data.
4. For graduation prediction, ensure the necessary data is available and accessible to the SVM model.
